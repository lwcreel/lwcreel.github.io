                I know, I know, horizontal stripes aren't my best look. In my defense, I was only a freshman when
                this photo was taken and, in my experience, freshmen have a lot
                to learn about a lot of things, not just fashion. As you can probably tell, this photo was taken
                around Christmas time of one of the most eventful years of my life. I had only recently made the
                decision to major in Computer Science at Texas A&M University, a decision which I firmly believe
                was the best decision of my life. In this photo you can see my older brother and sister, as well
                as my parents and the puppy, Sealy. The house we are in front of is my grandmother's,
                which I, along with my brother and the rest of our family, helped my father to build. There were
                always projects around the farm that needed to be done growing up, and helping and working alongside
                my dad to complete these jobs helped me develop a love for doing and a work ethic that I carry to
                this day.

            <p class="about">
                My love for programming stems from the love of doing that I developed growing up. There's something
                incredibly satisfying about building something from scratch that, before you, did not exist. This
                website is a perfect example. I would be lying if I said that I considered making this site, or any
                of the other projects, work because I have so much fun <i>doing</i>, making things that did not
                exist
                before.

            <p class="about">
                I was first introduced to computers as a medium for creation in a high school class that, at the
                time,
                I thought was completely useless. The story is actually interesting enough to relate here. So, I
                went
                to a small school. Like, really small. Thirty people in my whole grade small. One of the
                requirements to graduate high school in Texas is two consecutive years of a foreign language. Being
                that Spanish is the second most spoken language here, it shouldn't come as a surprise that almost
                everybody fills this requirement with that language. My freshman year, like every other student in
                my
                grade, I took Spanish I and passed easily (since my mom's family is Puerto Rican, I had a lot of
                prior
                exposure to the language despite not being a speaker of it myself). The trouble came when our
                Spanish
                teacher unexpectedly left the school the Summer before my sophomore year.

            <p class="about">
                Being a very small school, it's difficult enough to attract teachers already, and my school was
                unable
                to hire a Spanish teacher in time for the new school year. Naturally, my school decided that my
                grade
                would take Computer Science classes to count as our foreign language. To this day, I don't know how
                they swung that, but I'm glad they did. I had already taken Computer Science I, which at the time
                was
                a class on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and had a blast doing it. This sparked my love for computers,
                but
                Computer Science II was created just for my grade and it showed me a whole new world. Computer
                Science
                II was essentially a self-taught course, they gave us a book on Java, some computers, and a test
                every six weeks. In this class I realized that computers could make complicated tasks easy (and
                simple
                tasks hard).
            </p>
            <p class="about">
                Computer Science II sparked a love for programming that turned into a flame when I was exposed to
                MATLAB
                my freshman year at Texas A&M. Though I initially wanted to do Aerospace Engineering, I switched to
                Computer
                Science when I realized that the programming I did in MATLAB (which everyone on my team invariably
                hated)
                was what I enjoyed the most out of all my coursework. I switched to Computer Science and never
                looked back.

                <p class="about">
                    Other than my coursework, there are two organizations on-campus at Texas A&M University that
                    have played a
                    significant role in my life: Fish Camp and MSC ALOT. A bit of background for those uninitiated
                    to any of
                    TAMU's sub-cults, Fish Camp is a four day extended freshman orientation held at Lakeview
                    Methodist Conference
                    Center and MSC ALOT is the Memorial Student Center's Aggie Leaders of Tomorrow, a Freshman
                    Leadership
                    Organization that puts on programs run by freshmen. I have been a Fish Camp counselor for the
                    past two summers, and I have learned so much about myself in the
                    process. Counselors are responsible for leading Discussion Groups (DG) and for helping freshmen
                    to adjust to
                    Texas A&M. I decided to become a counelor after my experience freshman year. Coming from such a
                    small school,
                    A&M was a huge culture shock for me. Luckily I had the support of my DG "parents" to help me
                    orient myself in
                    the new environment. Because of this experience, I resolved to help support the incoming
                    freshmen in the same
                    way that I had been supported.

                The experiences I have had as part of MSC ALOT are irreplaceable in my life. My freshman year, I was
                a part
                of the subcommittee responsible for organizing and running TEDxTAMU, A&M's annual TED talk. My
                sophomore year,
                I was an assistant director in the subcommittee that organized Angel Tree, a Salvation Army program
                to bring
                Christmas to underpriviliged children. I am happy to have helped the program raise a record number
                of toys
                (over 1100) for Angel Tree. Through both of these programs I learned much about managing large scale
                projects
                and time-management against deadlines.

                Well, that's really all I care to tell some strangers on the internet about myself. Hopefully you
                enjoyed reading
                a bit about who I am. And if not, well that doesn't matter all that much to me. I had a great time
                making this
                page and writing all this down, and you made it to the end regardless, so as we say in Aggieland,
