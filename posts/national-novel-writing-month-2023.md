**Fifty thousand words in thirty days.**

That averages out to a little less than 1700 words on a page every single day for the entire month. I decided to participate in this annual challenge/charity event towards the tail end of finishing the first draft of my first novel, an epic fantasy titled _The Second Sunset_. It's an annual event and a 501(c)(3) non-profit. Those looking to learn more about the organization can do so here: [https://nanowrimo.org/](https://nanowrimo.org/).

First novels are usually pretty bad, and while I love and still love that book, revisions are needed. Knowing I'd want a break before I started those revisions, and not wanting to slow my momentum, a one month sprint get a fifty-thousand word novel done in thirty days seemed like a great way to keep on writing and to apply what I'd learned writing _The Second Sunset_.

Finish the first novel, take two weeks off, finish a second, take one month off, revise the first one. Seems like as good a schedule as any. I've always enjoyed writing and telling stories, but up to this point it's been strictly limited to the stories I tell myself, and the stories I made for Dungeons and Dragons. I'd never taken on and completed the task of completing a novel. It wasn't until I applied lessons I learned from the strength and conditioning world that I managed to finally achieve that goal.

They're really basic lessons, truthfully. Have a plan, do a little bit every day over a long period of time, and schedule breaks. Sure, my prose alternates between overly verbose and painfully simple. Certainly, my characterization is heavy-handed at best, non-existent at worst. Absolutely, my plotting is rough. But the first time I stuck a bar on my back, I couldn't stand up with my own bodyweight, a paltry 160 pounds, on it.

A year later, I squatted 315. A few years after that, I squatted 405. 

Ultimately, the only way to be good at something is to be bad at it first. It's an inherent act of vulnerability to try something new. Nobody likes being the novice, especially at something you're passionate about. In all likelihood, I'll someday cringe at this very post because I'll have improved so much in the intervening time. But cringing at _what you've done_ is just the sign that _you have grown_.

And that's a good thing, right?

So to give you something to cringe at right now, I'll end this post with a single-sentence excerpt from the novel I'm writing for NaNoWriMo 2023. It's probably my single favorite sentence I've ever written, and I fervently hope that someday I'll be able to cringe at it with you: 

_Mac stared across the half-mile radius that the wreckage of the **Matilda** covered, so lost in the throes of his own personal apocalypse that he almost didn’t notice when the radio transmitter crackled to life with a woman’s voice, half-lost in static._
