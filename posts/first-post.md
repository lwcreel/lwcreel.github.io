**This is my first blog post.**

But not the first blog post I've ever written. Just the first I ever actually put somewhere on the internet, instead of a folder tucked away under the inconspicuous 'miscellaneous' folder on my laptop. I enjoy writing, in a lot of different ways. I also enjoy routine, rituals, and so a blog might be a good idea.

We'll see.

There's a comfort in routine, especially for someone like me. If you look around the rest of the website, you'll see that I kind of _do_ a lot of things other than my job as a software engineer. I lift weights, I play Dungeouns and Dragons, I bake a stellar brownie, and I paint Warhammer miniatures (that's a new addition to my eclectic collection of hobbies). And so, routines are a valuable to me
because they help me keep things organized. I don't need to schedule time to workout, I know excactly when I'll do it. I'll play
DnD on a Sunday morning, bake on a Sunday afternoon, spend an hour after work on my writing, and so forth.

In any case, even this post may never see the light of day. I am, after all, writing this to procrastinate finishing the rest of my rebuild. The personal website I made in a few hours as a college sophomore with just HTML and Bootstrap could probably stand to be a bit more... professional. This is _technically_ the kind of work I get paid to do, so it'd be better if my website reflected that I can, in fact, code. 

Sometimes, I can even code well.

This website probably isn't one of those times but it _is_ better than the last iteration. Which, in all honesty, is enough for me.
