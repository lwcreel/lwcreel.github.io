**The Emperor Protects**

Or something like that.

I was told by a friend recently (Hi Kevin ðŸ™‚) that I should add pictures of some of my hobbies to my website. However, that would disrupt the _#minimalist #a e s t h e t i c_ thing I've got going on, so I'll put them here and wax poetic about one of my hobbies: Warhammer 40k. Warhammer 40k is a tabletop war game and hobby that revolves collecting and painting miniatures from  different galactic factions, humanity included, that are vying for dominance in the year 40,000. It's affectionately referred to as "plastic crack" by people in the community, and if you were to look up the prices involved in putting together a 2000 point army (generally considered a 'complete' army), you would see why.

As a complete and utter novice in Warhammer 40k, but not in painting miniatures, the process of getting into the game has been rather painless so far. It's my understanding that 10th edition is pretty streamlined compared to previous editions, an impressive accomplishment considering the core rulebook is 60 pages and each of the dozen or so factions has it's own special rulebook. I bought the Leviathan release box, a great start as it included what turned out to be around 30% of a full army for each of two of the game's most iconic factions: the Space Marines (the green army guys) and the Tyranids (the velociraptor with a gun).

My girlfriend and I agreed to each take one army, and I sadly assumed she'd want the power armour guys, not the ravenous bugs. So now we're sharing the Tyranids and I have a pretty shelf full of the Emperor's finest. While giant supersoldiers in armor that costs more than a spaceship are cool, there's something even cooler about a ravenous hive-mind that exists only to consume biomass. It's by far my favorite Sci-Fi trope, being first introduced to me via Halo's "the Flood".

I suppose the utter alienness of such a creature? Society? Is what makes them fascinating. You can't reason with something as brutally rational as the Tyranids/Flood/Zergs (well, maybe you can with the flood but that's an even deeper rabbit hole), you can only hold them off long enough to change the calculus of the engagement.

But then again, when the eldritch horror of the Tyranids is shrunk down to a 2-inch, plastic miniature, they're actually kinda cute.
