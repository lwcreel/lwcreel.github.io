**I am a nerd.**

A pretty big nerd too, if I'm being honest. I've played Dungeons and Dragons for about five years now, video games for about five-hundred years. I've watched Game of Thrones multiple times, all five seasons, and I can quote, verbatim, every word from the opening sequence of Skyrim up until you defeat Mirmulnir. Yes, that's their name, and no, I didn't look it up.

What's the point of saying all that?

The point is that, most people don't 'type' me as a nerd the first time we meet. And I get it, I workout and have a decent physique, and I can be pretty talkative in the right context. I don't exactly scream 'nerd' the first time you meet me, but it's always served as a pretty stark reminder of how much stock we put in appearances.

And how often appearances are deceiving.

Despite what people think when they first meet me, I've never even _seen_ a rugby field, let alone played. I was terrible at sports, the pinnacle of my athletics career was getting to be the designated hitter for my High School baseball team in a few regular season games. I think I went 1 for 5? I did get on with walks and errors a few times, so that was cool.

Nerd culture isn't blameless here either, far from it. Just let people be nerds, or jocks, or whatever they want. Don't assume, well, really anything about a person if you don't take the time to get to know them.

Maybe that guy with the inhaler is a state champion tennis player (he is), and maybe that guy that looks like he lifts has terrible hand-eye coordination (I do).

Just let people be nerds.
