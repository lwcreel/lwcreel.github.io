**I wrote fifty thousand words in thirty days.**

It wasn't easy, and it's not a masterpiece, but honestly I'm happy with the outcome. Considering all the travel and the busyness of November, I'm happy that I was able to consistently hit my daily word counts. Writing is fun, and I'm proud to have completed my second novel. Or at least my second first draft of a novel. 

I've learned a lot in regards to novels through the course of completing these two, but this second novel in particular was very informative. With _The Second Sunset_ I spent most of the time just white-knuckling through the word count. I had a vague idea where I was going, but for the most part it was just an exercise in convincing myself that I _could_ string together enough words to fill out a few hundred pages in a semi-coherent narrative.

With NaNoWriMo, I learned so much more about actually constructing something that was _good_. I figured out an outlining method that meshed well with my psyche and by focusing only on one character I learned how to convey personality through voice. It was useful, fun, and now I'm looking forward to my third novel. Maybe I'll actually do something with these someday, but for now I'm enjoying just having the works as something private for myself, my family, and frinds. Who knows.

In the meanwhile, I've been painting up a storm to try and finish my Tyranid army. I'll type up an update, photos included, once I finish painting everything _and_ when I feel like talking to myself on the internet again.
