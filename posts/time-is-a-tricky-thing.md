**Am I really going to have a bolded headline on every post?**

Anyway. See the title. When I originally started writing these blog posts, my thought was to write one monthly. It'd be good to have a body of work - in both writing and programming - that could be representative of where I'm at. Well, the time got away from Jann and I this year, just a little bit. Between visiting friends and family, attending weddings and planning our own, the year has blown by. It's been very good. We saw a lot of things that were pretty incredible, things that I wouldn't miss for anything, but being busy is tiring too.

As I'm currently writing this update, it's 11:03pm on a Thursday night. I don't really know why I got the impulse to put pen to paper publicly again, but I figured it was a good excuse to dust off the website and make some updates. I figured out how to add pagination to the blog, so things should be a bit more organized (hopefully?) now. The footer bar is still broken on mobile, but hopefully it'll be less noticeable with a shorter list of posts per page.

The buttons, for some unholy reason, only work on a double-click. Go figure. It's a small thing, but it bothers me. That small imperfection makes it hard to appreciate the fact that this feature is done. It's something I've been stuck on for awhile (at least since my last post here), and even though I figured out a way to implement it all I can see is the imperfect button. This got away from me a little bit, sorry about that. I'm going somewhere, I promise.

I think - at least for me - this roughly four hour programming and writing session is a microcosm of how I see time. It goes by faster than I think, and at the end of it is something new and cool that wouldn't exist without me, but the thing I notice is the imperfection. Missing the forest for the trees, as the saying goes.

This ended up being more introspective than my previous posts, and I'm okay with that. Ultimately, everything I write, wherever I write it, is mostly for me anyway. And I'll get around to fixing that button eventually. Probably.
