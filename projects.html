            As a bit of a disclaimer, the projects I have here are not the entirety of the projects that I have
            worked on. They are honestly not even the most impressive projects. This isn't a portfolio, it's simply
            the projects that I thought were cool enough to show off here. Anyone interested in some of my other
            work can feel free to check out my GitHub linked at the bottom of the page.

                    Out of the two projects that made the cut to be showcased here, Revielle Run is without a doubt
                    my favorite. This is an infinite side-scrolling platformer game that I made with a friend at the
                    CodeRed 2018 Hackothon. We built the game in Python using some of the wonderful libraries that
                    were available for game development, namely pygame and arcade, over the course of about twenty four
                    hours.
                    Though the game itself is pretty simple (and maybe a bit buggy) it is still without a doubt one of
                    the most fun projects I've done.

                    This project is one I made as a part of my coursework at Texas A&M. My team and I made
                    a computer within the circuitry program Logisim that could perform matrix addition (and
                    subtraction using two's complement). Additionally, the program to perform these operations
                    was written in an instruction set architecture that we created specifically for this purpose.
                    This computer could ultimately perform operations such as addition, subtraction,
                    a variety of memory operations, and a conditional check for whether a value was equal to zero.
