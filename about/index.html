        I know, I know, horizontal stripes aren't my best look. In my defense, I was only a freshman when 
        this photo was taken and, in my experience as a two-time Fish Camp counselor, freshmen have a lot 
        to learn about a lot of things, not just fashion. As you can probably tell, this photo was taken
        around Christmas time of one of the most eventful years of my life. I had only recently made the 
        decision to major in Computer Science at Texas A&M University, a decision which I firmly believe
        was the best decision of my life. In this photo you can see my older brother and sister, as well
        as my parents and the smol pupper named Sealy. The house we are in front of is my grandmother's,
        which I, along with my brother and the rest of our family, helped my father to build.
