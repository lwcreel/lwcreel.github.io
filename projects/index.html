    As a bit of a disclaimer, the projects I have here are not the entirety of the projects that I have
    worked on. They are honestly not even the most impressive projects. This isn't a portfolio, it's simply 
    the projects that I thought were cool enough to show off here. Anyone interested in some of my other
    work can feel free to check out my GitHub linked at the bottom of the page.

            Out of the two projects that made the cut to be showcased here, Revielle Run is without a doubt
            my favorite. This is an infinite side-scrolling platformer game that I made with a friend at the
            CodeRed 2018 Hackothon. We built the game in Python using some of the wonderful libraries that 
            were available for game development, namely pygame and arcade, over the course of about twenty four
            Though the game itself is pretty simple (and maybe a bit buggy) it is still without a doubt one of
            the most fun projects I've done.

<h1 class="prct-h1">2 x 2 Matrix Adder</h1>

                This project is one I made as a part of my coursework at Texas A&M. My team and I made
                a computer within the circuitry program Logisim that could perform matrix addition (and
                subtraction using two's complement). Additionally, the program to perform these operations
                was written in an instruction set architecture that we created specifically for this purpose.
                This computer could ultimately perform a variety of operations, including addition, subtraction,
                a variety of memory operations, and it could also check whether a value was equal to zero.
